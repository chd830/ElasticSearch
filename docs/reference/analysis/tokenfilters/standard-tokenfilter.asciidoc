major version.]

A token filter of type `standard` that normalizes tokens extracted with
the <<analysis-standard-tokenizer,Standard Tokenizer>>.

==================================================

The `standard` token filter currently does nothing.  It remains as a placeholder
in case some filtering function needs to be added in a future version.
