=== Settings changes

[float]
==== Remove support for elasticsearch.json and elasticsearch.yaml configuration file

The configuration file found in the Elasticsearch config directory could previously have
a `.yml`, `.yaml` or `.json` extension. Only `elasticsearch.yml` is now supported.

[float]
==== Duplicate keys in configuration file

In previous versions of Elasticsearch, the configuration file was allowed to
contain duplicate keys. For example:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
node:
  name: my-node

node
  attr:
    rack: my-rack
--------------------------------------------------

In Elasticsearch 6.0.0, this is no longer permitted. Instead, this must be
specified in a single key as:

[source,yaml]
--------------------------------------------------
node:
  name: my-node
  attr:
    rack: my-rack
--------------------------------------------------

[float]
==== Coercion of boolean settings

Previously, Elasticsearch recognized the strings `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`, `0`, `1` as booleans. Elasticsearch 6.0
recognizes only `true` and `false` as boolean and will throw an error otherwise. For backwards compatibility purposes, during the 6.x series
index settings on pre-6.0 indices will continue to work. Note that this does not apply to node-level settings that are stored
in `elasticsearch.yml`.

[float]
==== Snapshot settings

The internal setting `cluster.routing.allocation.snapshot.relocation_enabled` that allowed shards with running snapshots to be reallocated to
different nodes has been removed. Enabling this setting could cause allocation issues if a shard got allocated off a node and then
reallocated back to this node while a snapshot was running.

[float]
==== Store throttling settings

Store throttling has been removed. As a consequence, the
`indices.store.throttle.type` and `indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec`
cluster settings and the `index.store.throttle.type` and
`index.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec` index settings are not
recognized anymore.

[float]
==== Store settings

The `default` `index.store.type` has been removed. If you were using it, we
advise that you simply remove it from your index settings and Elasticsearch
will use the best `store` implementation for your operating system.

[float]
==== Network settings

The blocking TCP client, blocking TCP server, and blocking HTTP server have been removed.
As a consequence, the `network.tcp.blocking_server`, `network.tcp.blocking_client`,
`network.tcp.blocking`,`transport.tcp.blocking_client`, `transport.tcp.blocking_server`,
and `http.tcp.blocking_server` settings are not recognized anymore.

The previously unused settings `transport.netty.max_cumulation_buffer_capacity`,
`transport.netty.max_composite_buffer_components` and
`http.netty.max_cumulation_buffer_capacity` have been removed.

[float]
==== Similarity settings

The `base` similarity is now ignored as coords and query normalization have
been removed. If provided, this setting will be ignored and issue a
deprecation warning.

[float]
==== Script Settings

All of the existing scripting security settings have been removed.  Instead
they are replaced with `script.allowed_types` and `script.allowed_contexts`.

[float]
==== Discovery Settings

The `discovery.type` settings no longer supports the values `gce`, `azure` and `ec2`.
Integration with these platforms should be done by setting the `discovery.zen.hosts_provider` setting to
one of those values.

[float]
==== Cross-cluster search settings renamed

The cross-cluster search remote cluster connection infrastructure is also used
in cross-cluster replication. This means that the setting names
`search.remote.*` used for configuring cross-cluster search belie the fact that
they also apply to other situations where a connection to a remote cluster as
used.  Therefore, these settings have been renamed from `search.remote.*` to
`cluster.remote.*`. For backwards compatibility purposes, we will fallback to
`search.remote.*` if `cluster.remote.*` is not set. For any such settings stored
in the cluster state, or set on dynamic settings updates, we will automatically
upgrade the setting from `search.remote.*` to `cluster.remote.*`. The fallback
settings will be removed in 8.0.0.
