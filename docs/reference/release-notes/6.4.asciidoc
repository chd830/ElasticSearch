[[release-notes-6.4.1]]
== {es} version 6.4.1

[float]
=== Bug Fixes

Rollover::
{es} can once again start if any shards on the node have been
<<indices-rollover-index, rolled over>>. {pull}33394[#33394]

[[release-notes-6.4.0]]
== {es} version 6.4.0

[float]
=== Known issues

{es} 6.4.0 fails to start when PEM encoded private key files that have been exported from `PKCS#12`
keystores are in use. These files can be identified by the existence of lines that start with either
`Bag Attributes` or `Key Attributes` in the beginning of the key file.

These keys can be converted to a supported format using one of the following methods:

* Remove the extra lines from the beginning of the file so that the file starts with the line that starts
  with `-----BEGIN`
* Use openssl to convert it, i.e: `openssl pkcs8 -in old_format.key -topk8 -nocrypt -out new_format.key`
  assuming the key was not password protected.
