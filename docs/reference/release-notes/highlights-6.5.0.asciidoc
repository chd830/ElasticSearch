=== Audit security events in new structured logs 

By default, when you enable auditing, it uses the 
{stack-ov}/audit-log-output.html[logfile audit output], which persists events to 
a `<clustername>_audit.log` file in the logs directory. This file is new to 
version 6.5 and prints audit entries as JSON documents. 

For backwards compatibility purposes, a `<clustername>_access.log` with the old style of 
formatting is also generated. See also <<breaking_65_settings_changes>>.

=== Discover the structure of text files

experimental[] The new <<ml-find-file-structure,find file structure API>> 
determines the structure of a text file. It also returns statistics about the 
most common values of the detected fields and mappings that you can use when you 
ingest the file into {es}. If you want to influence the output, you can specify 
optional parameters. For example, if the file contains semi-structured text, you 
can specify a Grok pattern or let the tool generate it. This API is also used by 
the new File Data Visualizer in {kib}.

=== Improved {ml} results for partitioned multi-metric jobs

If you use the +partition_field_name+ or +by_field_name+ parameters in a {ml} job (or the 
*Split Data* field in the {kib} multi-metric job wizard), it generates many 
simultaneous analyses that are modeled independently. In 6.5, we have decreased 
the influence of the anomaly scores in each partition on other partitions' scores. 
As a result, record- and influencer-level results produce a much wider range of scores, 
but the overall anomaly score still uses sophisticated aggregation to ensure rate-limited 
alerts for the job. 

[float]
=== Find multi-bucket anomalies in {ml} jobs

Sometimes events are not interesting or anomalous in the context of a single 
bucket. However, they become interesting when you take into consideration a 
sequence of buckets as a whole. In 6.5, there is a new {ml} 
_multi-bucket analysis_, which uses features from multiple contiguous buckets 
for anomaly detection. The final anomaly score is now a combination of values 
from both the “standard” single-bucket analysis and the new multi-bucket 
analysis. A new `multi_bucket_impact` property in the 
<<ml-results-records,record results>> indicates how strongly either form of 
analysis influences the score. In {kib}, anomalies with medium or high 
multi-bucket impact are depicted in the *Anomaly Explorer* and the 
*Single Metric Viewer* with a cross symbol instead of a dot. 

[float]
=== Create source-only snapshots

<<_source_only_repository, Source-only snapshots>> save space on disk by only
saving stored fields and index metadata. This can result in up to 50% reduction
in size. Index and doc values are not included, so a restored source-only
snapshot is not searchable. You must reindex the data into a new index after it's
restored.

[float]
=== Apply token filters conditionally

The <<analysis-condition-tokenfilter,conditional token filter>> enables you to
use inline Painless scripts to filter out terms. Previously, conditionally
applying token filters required creating and using custom analysis plugins.

[float]
=== Use ODBC to connect to {es} SQL

{es} SQL now supports ODBC mode in addition to JDBC. The functionality is
currently the same as JDBC. An alpha version of the ODBC client is now
available for download.

[float]
=== Delegate authorization to other realms

If you enable the {es} {security-features}, some realms now have the 
ability to perform _authentication_ internally then delegate _authorization_ to 
another realm. For example, you could authenticate using PKI then delegate to an 
LDAP realm for role information. The realms that support this feature have a 
new `authorization_realms` setting that you can configure in the 
`elasticsearch.yml` file. For more information, see 
{stack-ov}/realm-chains.html#authorization_realms[Realm chains] and <<realm-settings>>. 

[float]
=== Cross-cluster replication (beta^*^)

Cross-cluster replication enables you to replicate indices that exist in remote 
clusters to your local cluster. You create an index in your local cluster 
(known as a _follower index_) that follows an index (known as a _leader index_)
in a remote cluster. You can also automatically follow indices in a 
remote cluster that match a pattern. The individual write operations that occur 
on the leader indices are then replayed on the follower indices. This 
functionality is useful for replicating data to a second cluster for disaster 
recovery purposes and for geo-proximity so that reads can be served locally.

For more information, see {stack-ov}/xpack-ccr.html[Cross-cluster replication] 
and <<ccr-apis>>. 

[float]
=== Monitor {es} with {metricbeat} (beta^*^)

In 6.4 and later, you can use {metricbeat} to collect data about {kib} and ship 
it directly to your monitoring cluster, rather than routing it through {es}. Now 
in 6.5, you can also use {metricbeat} to collect and ship data about {es}. If 
you are monitoring {ls} or Beats, at this time you must still use exporters to 
route the data. See <<configuring-metricbeat>> and 
{stack-ov}/how-monitoring-works.html[How monitoring works]. 
 

^*^ This functionality is in beta and is subject to change. The design and code 
is less mature than official GA features and is being provided as-is with no 
warranties. Please try this functionality in your test and development environments 
and provide feedback in the https://discuss.elastic.co/[Elastic community forums].
